# What is this

A collection of my dark modes. Use Stylus or some other browser extension to apply them to websites.

## FandomWikia - Fate／Grand Order - DarkMode

This is a simplistic dark mode for [Fandom Fate/Grand Order Wikia](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Fate/Grand_Order_Wikia). In this case, simplistic stands not only for the design of the pages and removal of videos, but also how the code was written (I've seen code much more convulated than this).

I made this mainly for myself, as all general purpose Fandom Wikia CSS most of the time generate a huge deformed mess. This code should be simple and also human readable.

As this was made to satisfy myself, not everyone will enjoy it. However, suggestions are welcome.
